      SP Balasubrahmanyam & Wife felicitated by K. J. Yesudas
      Balasubrahmanyam made his debut as a playback singer on 15 December 1966 with Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna, a
      Telugu film scored by his mentor, S. P. Kodandapani.[38][39] The first non-Telugu song that he recorded just eight days after his debut Telugu song was in Kannada in 1966 for the film Nakkare Ade Swarga, starring Kannada comedy stalwart T. R. Narasimharaju.[40][41] He recorded his first Tamil song "Athaanodu Ippadi Irundhu Eththanai Naalaachu", a duet with L. R. Eswari under the musical direction of M. S. Viswanathan for the film Hotel Ramba,
      which was never released. Other early songs he sang were duets with P. Susheela, "Iyarkai Ennum Ilaya Kanni" in the 1969 film Shanti Nilayam, starring Gemini Ganesh, and "Aayiram Nilavae Vaa" for M. G. Ramachandran in
      Adimaippenn.[42] His first song with S. Janaki was "Pournami Nilavil Pani Vizhum Iravil" in Kannippenn. He was
      then introduced to the Malayalam film industry by G. Devarajan in the film Kadalppalam. Balasubrahmanyam had the distinction of rendering the most songs on a single day by any singer. He had
      recorded 21 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra Kumar in Bangalore from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm on 8 February
      1981 and 19 songs in Tamil, 16 songs in Hindi in a day. In his words, "There were days when I used to record
      15–20 songs, but only for Anand-Milind. And I would take the last flight back to Chennai."[45][46] In the 1970s,
      he used to
      sing in towns and villages all over south India and Ilaiyaraaja, then an unknown harmonium and guitar player
      accompanied him in his concerts.</br></br>

      Balasubrahmanyam pictured in 1985nBalasubrahmanyam came to international prominence with the 1980 film Sankarabharanam. The film is considered to be
      one of the best films ever to emerge from the Telugu film industry. Directed by K. Vishwanath, the film's
      soundtrack was composed by K.V. Mahadevan, and led to an increase in the usage of Carnatic music in Telugu cinema. Not a classically trained singer, he used a "film music" aesthetic in recording the songs.[49] Balasubrahmanyam received his first National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for his work. His first work in Hindi filmsnwas in the following year, in Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981), for which he received another National Film Award for BestnMale Playback Singer.In 1989, Balasubrahmanyam was the playback singer for actor Salman Khan in the blockbuster Maine Pyar Kiya.
      The soundtrack for the film was very successful and he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for then song Dil Deewana. For much of the next decade, Balasubrahmanyam continued as the "romantic singing voice" on the soundtracks of Khan's films.[52] Notable among these was Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! which became the highest-grossing
      Hindi film of all time. Balasubrahmanyam's duet with Lata Mangeshkar, "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", was very
      popular. This solidified Balasubrahmanyam as one of the biggest playback singers in India.SP Balasubrahmanyam
      became identified as Salman Khan's voice in the 90s just like Kishore Kumar became Rajesh Khanna’s voice through
      the 70s.</br></br>
